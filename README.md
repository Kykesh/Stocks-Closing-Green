# Stock Market Tracker Web Application

## Overview

The Stock Market Tracker is a simple web application designed to track the number of stocks on your watchlist that closed the day in green (i.e., with a rise in stock value). It's a basic counter application that allows you to increment a counter each time a stock closes green and save the daily count for later reference.

### Features

- **Count Increment:** Add to the count every time a stock on your watchlist closes green.
- **Save Functionality:** Save the daily count of green-closing stocks for historical reference.
- **Stock Market Themed Interface:** A user-friendly interface themed around the stock market.

## Setup

To set up the Stock Market Tracker on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone/Download the Repository:**
   - Use Git to clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it in your desired location.

2. **Locate the Files:**
   - Navigate to the directory where you have placed the extracted files.

3. **Open the HTML File:**
   - Double-click on `index.html` to open the application in your default web browser.

   ## Usage

- **Adding a Stock:**
  - Click on the `ADD STOCK` button each time a stock from your watchlist closes green.
- **Saving the Count:**
  - Click on the `SAVE` button to save the current count. This will reset the counter for the next session but keep the saved count visible on the screen.
